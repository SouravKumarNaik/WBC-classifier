Classification of white blood cells (WBCs) is crucial for diagnosing leukemia and other blood-related conditions. Although manual diagnosis by medical experts is accurate, it is also labor-intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these constraints, computer- aided diagnosis is essential. Despite the considerable success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in classification tasks, their performance is impeded by substantial challenges in the dataset. The challenges encompass limited data availability, high intra-class variability with noticeable variations in WBC morphology, and problems such as staining contrasts and resolution limitations in microscopic images, all of which contribute to impact classification accuracy. To overcome the challenges above, a novel network known as the Adaptive Feature Modulation Network (AFMNet) is proposed. The proposed AMFNet integrates two sophisticated components: The Attention Recalibration Module (ARM) and the Dynamic Feature Attention Block (DFAB). ARM improves the networkâ€™s capacity to prioritize important characteristics and incorporates global and local contextual information, enhancing sensitivity to subtle patterns and ensuring more precise and robust classification. DFAB analyzes long- range dependencies by examining pixel correlations within feature maps, facilitating comprehension of global context and spatial relationships. Integrating these techniques in AFMNet successfully addresses issues such as significant intra-class variability. This enhances feature extraction and classification performance, particularly in intricate WBC categorization tasks. Empirical evidence confirms that the proposed method effectively addresses the challenges in WBC classification and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques.
